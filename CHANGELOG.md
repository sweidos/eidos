# Changelog

All notable changes to `eidos` will be documented here.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [1.0.16] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- README and Learn docs updated — added cross-origin usage examples, URL pattern syntax table, Vue/Svelte/vanilla stores section; roadmap updated to reflect shipped features.

---

## [1.0.15] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **URL pattern matching** — `resource()` now accepts wildcard and named-parameter patterns. The pattern is compiled to a regex and sent to the SW, which tests the pathname (or full URL for cross-origin) on every intercepted fetch:
  ```ts
  resource('/api/products/*',   { offline: true })  // single segment
  resource('/api/products/**',  { offline: true })  // multi-segment
  resource('/api/users/:id',    { offline: true })  // named segment
  ```
  `fetch()`/`json()`/`query()`/`prefetch()` throw on pattern handles (no single URL to fetch); `invalidate()` and `unregister()` still work.

- **Cross-origin resource support** — pass a full URL (with origin) to register a cross-origin resource. The SW fast-path checks the full request URL before falling back to pathname matching:
  ```ts
  resource('https://api.example.com/products', { offline: true })
  resource('https://cdn.example.com/assets/*', { offline: true })
  ```

---

## [1.0.14] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **Framework-agnostic reactive stores** — `stores.ts` exports six `EidosReadable<T>` stores that implement the Svelte store contract (`subscribe(run): unsubscribe`). Zero extra dependencies; usable in Svelte (native `$` prefix), Vue composables, or plain JS:
  ```ts
  import { eidosQueue, eidosStatus, eidosQueueStats, eidosResource, eidosAction, eidosStore } from '@sweidos/eidos'
  ```
  `EidosReadable` type is exported from the package index.

---

## [1.0.13] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **`store.ts` decoupled from React** — the store is now a plain JS event emitter with zero React imports. `useEidosStore` is exported as `{ getState, subscribe, setState }` instead of a callable hook. The React 18 `useSyncExternalStore` subscription lives in `react/hooks.ts`, making the store usable outside React contexts.

---

## [1.0.12] — 2026-06-09

### Added

- **`useEidosOnDrain(callback)`** — fires `callback` once each time the action queue transitions from non-empty → 0. Always calls the latest callback version (stable ref pattern — no stale closures). Use for "all synced!" toasts:
  ```ts
  import { useEidosOnDrain } from '@sweidos/eidos'
  useEidosOnDrain(() => toast.success('All offline actions synced!'))
  ```

### Fixed (playground accessibility)

- **`role="alert"` on error/offline states** — products fetch errors (`offline · no cached response yet`, `fetch failed`) and order results now have `role="alert"` so screen readers announce them immediately. Previously all error feedback was visual-only with no AT announcement.

---

## [1.0.11] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`useEidosQueueStats()`** — count-only queue hook returning `{ pending, failed, replaying, total }`. Four independent primitive selectors, each re-rendering only when its count changes. Cheaper than `useEidosQueue()` for badge/status-bar components that only need numbers:
  ```ts
  import { useEidosQueueStats } from '@sweidos/eidos'

  const { pending, failed, replaying, total } = useEidosQueueStats()
  ```

### Fixed (playground)

- **Skip link** — `<a href="#main-content">` before the header lets keyboard users jump past navigation in one keystroke. Visually hidden until focused (Tailwind `sr-only focus:not-sr-only`).
- **Smooth scroll** — `html { scroll-behavior: smooth }` added to `index.css`, so anchor links in the API docs (Learn page) scroll smoothly. Overridden to `auto` for `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (already set).
- **Failed badge** — Actions tab now shows a red `failed` count badge alongside the existing amber `pending` badge, powered by `useEidosQueueStats()`.

---

## [1.0.10] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`useEidosAction(id)`** — new hook that subscribes to a single queue item by ID. Only re-renders when that specific item changes, making it more efficient than `useEidosQueue().find(id)` (which re-renders on any queue mutation):
  ```ts
  import { useEidosAction } from '@sweidos/eidos'

  const result = await createOrder(payload) // { queued: true, id: 'abc123', ... }
  const item = useEidosAction(result.id)
  // item?.status → 'pending' | 'replaying' | 'succeeded' | 'failed'
  // undefined once removed from the queue
  ```
  Complements `useEidosResource(url)` — same pattern for actions.

---

## [1.0.9] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **`replayQueue()` now returns `ReplayResult`** — the function previously returned `Promise<void>`. It now returns a summary of what happened:
  ```ts
  const result = await replayQueue()
  // { attempted: 3, succeeded: 2, failed: 0, retrying: 1, skipped: 0 }
  ```
  Backwards-compatible — callers that ignore the return value are unaffected.

### Added

- **`ReplayResult` type exported** — import it for typed result handling:
  ```ts
  import type { ReplayResult } from '@sweidos/eidos'
  ```

### Fixed (playground accessibility)

- **`aria-expanded` on accordion buttons** — `ResourceRow` (Resources page) and `Collapse` (API docs) now expose correct expanded/collapsed state to assistive technologies.
- **`aria-label` on section anchor links** — `#` permalink anchors in the API docs now have accessible labels.
- **`role="region"` on collapsible panels** — expanded Collapse panels are semantically marked as regions.

---

## [1.0.8] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`clearQueue()`** — new exported function that removes all items from the action queue (both IndexedDB and the in-memory store). Useful for "clear all failed" UI controls and test teardown.
  ```ts
  import { clearQueue } from '@sweidos/eidos'
  await clearQueue()
  ```

### Fixed (playground)

- **`prefers-reduced-motion` respected** — all animations (`fade-in`, `slide-right`, `pulse`, `blink`) are disabled via a global `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` rule in `index.css`.
- **Emoji icons replaced** — `ResultBadge` in the demo used emoji/unicode characters (`⚡`, `↑`, `⚠`, `✕`) as visual indicators. Replaced with Lucide SVG icons (`Zap`, `ArrowUp`, `AlertTriangle`, `X`) per accessibility best practices.

---

## [1.0.7] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`VERSION` export** — `@sweidos/eidos` now exports a `VERSION` constant so host apps can display the package version without importing `package.json`.
- **`idbGetPendingItems()`** — internal IDB helper that uses the `status` index to fetch only `pending`/`failed` items. `replayQueue` now calls this instead of `idbGetQueue()` + JS-side filter, avoiding a full table scan when many items have already succeeded.

### Changed

- **Performance** — `replayQueue` reads only actionable items from IDB via index scan, not the full queue.
- README: added **Performance** section documenting bundle size, re-render model, parallel replay, IDB index scan, network timeout, pre-activation buffer, and concurrency safety.

---

## [1.0.6] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Removed `zustand` dependency** — the store is now implemented with React's native `useSyncExternalStore` (React 18+). No external state library needed. Zero new dependencies introduced.
- **Bundle size −47%** — `dist/eidos.es.js` drops from 35 kB → 18.6 kB (gzip: 7.9 kB → 5.0 kB). The package previously bundled all of zustand; the replacement store is ~40 lines.
- **`useEidosStatus` re-render model improved** — now uses three independent primitive selectors instead of a single combined selector with `useShallow`. Each field (`isOnline`, `swStatus`, `swError`) only triggers a re-render in its own subscription.

### Migration

No API changes. If your app imports `zustand` only because Eidos pulled it in as a transitive dependency, you can now remove it from your own `package.json`.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **`action()` anonymous-function `actionId` collision** — `??` was used to derive `actionId`, meaning an empty-string `fn.name` (anonymous arrow function) passed through as `''`, causing all unnamed actions to share the same registry key and overwrite each other. Switched to `||` so empty string correctly falls through to `uid()`.
- **Dev warning for unstable `neverLose` action names** — if no `config.name` is provided and `fn.name` is empty, a console warning is emitted in development. Without a stable name, queued items cannot be replayed after a page reload.

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **`replayQueue` concurrency lock** — concurrent calls (e.g. two rapid `online` events or a manual call overlapping an auto-replay) previously both read the same pending items before either marked them `replaying`, risking double-execution of `neverLose` actions. A `_replaying` flag now gates entry so only one replay pass runs at a time; subsequent calls are no-ops until the pass completes.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Pre-activation message buffer** — `sendToWorker` now queues any message sent before the SW is active and flushes the buffer on activation. Previously only resource registrations were re-sent (via `flushResourceRegistrations`); calls to `invalidate()`, `setOfflineSimulation()`, or any other SW message at module scope were silently dropped. The old `flushResourceRegistrations` helper is removed — buffering covers it generically.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **`useEidosStatus` spurious re-renders** — selector now uses `useShallow`; components no longer re-render when unrelated store state changes (cache hits, resource updates, queue mutations)
- **Runtime subscriber leak** — `useEidosStore.subscribe()` return value is now stored and called by `_resetEidos()`, preventing listener accumulation on HMR and in test suites
- **`network-first` main-thread bypass** — `resource.fetch()` was doing cache-first logic for all strategies; `network-first` resources now go directly to the network and only fall back to cache on failure, matching the declared intent
- **`NetworkFirst` SW strategy hangs on slow networks** — fetch is now aborted after 3 seconds (`AbortSignal.timeout(3000)`), matching the `networkTimeoutSeconds: 3` advertised in the strategy's `equivalentCode`

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **`replayQueue` runs in parallel** — pending actions are now replayed concurrently via `Promise.allSettled` instead of sequentially; a queue of N items no longer takes N × round-trip time to drain

### Fixed

- **SW activation timeout** — `waitForActivation` now resolves after 10 seconds regardless, preventing a silent hang when another browser tab holds an older SW version open
- **`resource.fetch()` double cache open** — `caches.open()` was called twice on network failure (once in `try`, once in `catch`); cache handle is now hoisted and reused
- **`resource.invalidate()` full-URL mismatch** — cache keys were matched by pathname only; now also matches exact URL (`r.url === url`), fixing invalidation when the resource was registered with an absolute URL
- **`idbUpdateQueueItem` silent no-op** — missing item in IDB now logs a dev-mode warning instead of silently skipping the `put`, surfacing store/IDB divergence early
- **Queue item IDs** — `uid()` switched from `Date.now() + Math.random()` to `crypto.randomUUID()` for guaranteed uniqueness

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-05

First stable release.

### Added

**Core package**
- `ResourceConfig.maxAge` — TTL in milliseconds; expired cache entries trigger a network re-fetch
- `ResourceHandle.unregister()` — remove a resource from the SW registry and Zustand store
- `ActionQueueItem.nextRetryAt` — epoch timestamp set by exponential backoff; items not yet due are skipped on each replay pass
- `sideEffects: false` in `package.json` — enables tree-shaking in bundlers

### Changed

- **Exponential backoff on queue replay** — failed `neverLose` actions are retried at `min(2s × 2^retryCount, 5min)` ±20% jitter instead of immediately
- **`cacheName` override now respected** — `ResourceConfig.cacheName` is correctly propagated to the generated strategy and SW registration (was silently ignored in 0.x)
- **`EIDOS_CLEAR_CACHE` uses per-resource bucket** — SW now looks up the registered `cacheName` per URL instead of always clearing `eidos-resources-v1`

### Fixed

- SWR background revalidation now wrapped in `event.waitUntil()` — prevents the SW from being terminated before the cache write completes
- Dev-mode warning when `resource()` is called twice for the same URL with different config
- Dev-mode warning when `neverLose` action args are not JSON-serializable (args would be silently lost after a page reload)

### Infrastructure

- GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) — builds and deploys playground to Vercel, publishes `@sweidos/eidos` to npm when version bumps, creates GitHub Release
- Root `vercel.json` — fixes Vercel cloud builds for the monorepo (`rootDirectory: null` + `cd ../..` bug)
- URL routing in playground — `react-router-dom` replaces `useState`-based page switching; browser back/forward and deep links now work

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline — first automated deploy and npm publish

### Fixed

- Playground navigation now uses React Router — deep links work, browser history works

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-03

Initial release. Smallest possible version that demonstrates the vision end-to-end.

### Added

**Core package (`@sweidos/eidos`)** — npm `@sweidos/eidos@0.1.0`
- `resource(url, config)` — register an offline-capable resource with auto-generated caching strategy
- `action(fn, config)` — wrap any async function with `best-effort` or `neverLose` reliability
- `replayQueue()` — manually replay the IndexedDB-persisted action queue
- `EidosProvider` — React root component that registers the SW and initialises the runtime
- `useEidosStatus()` — online + SW status hook
- `useEidosResource(url)` — live cache state for a single resource
- `useEidosQueue()` — reactive action queue
- `setOfflineSimulation(enabled)` — toggle offline simulation from devtools or tests
- Full TypeScript types with JSDoc comments

**Service Worker (`eidos-sw.js`)**
- `CacheFirst`, `StaleWhileRevalidate`, `NetworkFirst` strategies

- Full interactive dashboard (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)
- Overview page: live status, Products demo, Orders demo
- Resources page: per-resource cache inspector with expandable strategy detail
- Action Queue page: live queue with replay controls
- Intent Inspector page: step-by-step intent → strategy → SW rule trace
- How It Works page: architecture diagrams and lifecycle docs
- Offline simulation toggle in header
- Mock API (`/api/products`, `/api/orders`) served via Vite plugin

**Monorepo**
- pnpm workspace with `packages/core`, `packages/worker`, `apps/playground`
